  - title: 'Land-use and climate drive shifts in *Bombus* assemblage composition'
    company: 'Utah State University'
    date_start: '2017-06-01'
    date_end: '2021-04-01'
    description: >-
        Our objective was to link differences in bumble bee (*Bombus*) diversity to landscape composition and climate in agroecosystems in order to understand their co-occurring effects. 

        
  - title: 'Variation in upper thermal tolerance of *Bombus griseocollis* and *B. impatiens* (Hymenoptera: Apidae)'
    company: 'Utah State University'
    date_start: '2020-09-01'
    date_end: '2021-04-01'
    description: >-
        Our objective was to compare the upper thermal tolerance of a commercially available, eastern North American bumble bee species, *Bombus impatiens*, to the upper thermal tolerance of a wild and broadly distributed species, *Bombus griseocollis*.
      
  - title: 'Incidental captures of *Bombus* species in traps: a national survey'
    company: 'Utah State University'
    date_start: '2019-06-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: >-
       Our objectives were to characterize the nature and scope of *Bombus* bycatch throughout the U.S. to better understand regional effects of traps on pollinator communities and evaluate differences in landscape composition and configuration to determine the effect of agricultural land management practices on pollinator diversity.
        
  - title: 'Assessing the impact of bycatch on *Bombus griseocollis* colony growth and development'
'
    company: 'Utah State University'
    date_start: '2019-06-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: >-
       Our objective was to measure the impact of bycatch on bumble bee colony growth and development.
