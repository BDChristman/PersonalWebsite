  - title: 'Land-use and climate drive shifts in *Bombus* assemblage composition'
    company: 'Utah State University'
    date_start: '2017-06-01'
    date_end: '2021-04-01'
    description: >-
        Our objective was to link differences in bumble bee (*Bombus*) diversity to landscape composition and climate in agroecosystems in order to understand their co-occurring effects. 

        
  - title: 'Variation in upper thermal tolerance of *Bombus griseocollis* and *B. impatiens* (Hymenoptera: Apidae)'
    company: 'Utah State University'
    date_start: '2020-09-01'
    date_end: '2021-04-01'
    description: >-
        Our objective was to compare the upper thermal tolerance of a commercially available, eastern North American bumble bee species, *Bombus impatiens*, to the upper thermal tolerance of a wild and broadly distributed species, *Bombus griseocollis*.
