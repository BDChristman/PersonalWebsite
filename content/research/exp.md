  - title: 'Incidental captures of *Bombus* species in traps: a national survey'
    company: 'Biology Department and Ecology Center, Utah State University'
    date_start: '2019-06-01'

    description: >-
      Federal and state agencies deploy thousands of traps in agricultural fields throughout the U.S. to conduct annual field surveys for early detection of non-native Lepidopterans. It is well known that *Bombus* are commonly collected as bycatch within these insect traps; however, no study has assessed regional variation in bycatch composition. Therefore, our objectives are to characterize the nature and scope of *Bombus* bycatch throughout the U.S. to better understand regional effects of traps on pollinator communities and to evaluate differences in landscape composition and configuration to determine the effect of agricultural land management practices on pollinator diversity. Bycatch was collected from insect traps within 431 agricultural fields throughout Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia from 2018 to 2020. Thus far, a total of 3,238 Bombus representing 17 species were collected across the various states. *Bombus fervidus, B. bimaculatus, B. impatiens, B. pensylvanicus,* and *B. huntii* are the five most abundant species within traps, comprising 86% of total captures. Species richness is consistent with published data suggesting that Bombus captures may be representative of the expected community. However, some of the commonly trapped species (*B. fervidus, B. pensylvanicus,* and *B. auricomus*) are historically uncommon throughout their ranges. Future work will seek to evaluate how large-scale environmental features drive pollinator diversity and community composition.
