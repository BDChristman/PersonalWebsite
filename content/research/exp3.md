  - title: 'Climate risk assessment of Utah National Forests: A case study for Northern Goshawks (*Accipiter gentilis*)'
    company: 'Climate Adaptation Science Program, Utah State University'
    date_start: '2019-08-01'

    description: >-
      Climate change is negatively impacting national forest ecosystems, which results in both direct and indirect effects on goshawk populations. This study uses an interdisciplinary, spatially explicit approach to examine the impact of climate change, landscape change, and public engagement with Utah national forest ecosystems to promote management of suitable habitats for northern goshawks. Our objectives are to 1) develop a habitat suitability model for goshawks in Utah national forests, 2) model landscape change in the region as a result of climate-influenced factors such as wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestation, 3) examine patterns and projections of climate variables relevant to goshawk reproduction, and 4) better understand Utah national forest user perceptions of climate change impacts on ecosystems. We are creating a literature-based habitat suitability model for goshawks in Utah national forests. Forest Vegetation Simulator is being used to predict wildfire and mountain pine beetle risk susceptibility in each national forest. We are examining temperature and precipitation variation using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5), which allows us to project these variables under different emission scenarios. An online state-representative survey was deployed to explore public use of national forest lands, perceptions of climate change impacts, and likelihood of engagement with the forest service. This project contributes to a better understanding of goshawk habitat requirements and projected habitat threats under climate change. Additionally, it provides a holistic view of managing national forests with consideration of forest usersâ€™ activities, values, and likelihood to engage. This framework can be used to guide the development of climate risk assessments for other species.
