**Incidental captures of Bombus species in traps - a national survey**

Federal and state agencies deploy thousands of traps in agricultural fields throughout the U.S. to conduct annual field surveys for early detection of non-native Lepidopterans. It is well known that Bombus are commonly collected as bycatch within these insect traps; however, no study has assessed regional variation in bycatch composition. Therefore, our objectives were to characterize the nature and scope of Bombus bycatch throughout the U.S. to better understand regional effects of traps on pollinator communities and evaluate differences in landscape composition and configuration to determine the effect of agricultural land management practices on pollinator diversity. Bycatch was collected from insect traps within agricultural fields throughout Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia from 2018 to 2020. Bombus fervidus, B. bimaculatus, B. impatiens, B. pensylvanicus, and B. huntii were the five most abundant species within traps, comprising 86% of total captures. Species richness was consistent with published data suggesting that Bombus captures are representative of the expected community. However, some of the commonly trapped species (B. fervidus, B. pensylvanicus, and B. auricomus) are historically uncommon throughout their ranges.
