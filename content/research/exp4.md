  - title: 'Variation in upper thermal tolerance of Bombus griseocollis and B. impatiens (Hymenoptera: Apidae)'

      The use of commercialized bumble bee (*Bombus*) colonies is increasing throughout the U.S. In order to make *Bombus* colonies available to producers across the country, there is an opportunity to diversify the market with species that are endemic to the areas they are employed. Identifying speciesâ€™ tolerance to environmental extremes can assist with the commercialization of colonies for specific cropping systems and geographic regions. Here, we compared the upper thermal tolerance of two endemic North American bumble bee species - *Bombus impatiens*, a successfully commercialized species found in the eastern U.S., and *Bombus griseocollis*, a broadly distributed species that has not yet been commercialized. Additionally, we tested whether upper thermal tolerance varied within species by intertegular distance (ITD), body mass, and percent lipid. We found that the larger, wild *B. griseocollis* had a significantly higher thermal tolerance at death than the smaller, commercial *B. impatiens* (46.39C and 45.36C, respectively). However, within a species, temperature at death increased with lower ITD and dry mass, suggesting that smaller individuals have a higher thermal tolerance than their larger counterparts. A higher thermal tolerance is advantageous for colony commercialization, particularly in the western U.S. where temperatures are increasing due to ongoing and projected climate change. Overall, we found that *B. griseocollis* exhibit promising traits that are conducive for commercialization and could be a key species for pollination in diverse regions throughout the U.S.
