I am an Ecology PhD Candidate in the Biology Department as well as a National Science Foundation Trainee within the Climate Adaptation Science Program at Utah State University. Broadly, I am interested in data-driven projects that integrate ecology, modeling, and geospatial analysis.  

My current research evaluates the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on bumble bee diversity, colony growth, and development both on a state and national scale. My goal is to produce research that both informs and helps promote positive conservation and management practices.
