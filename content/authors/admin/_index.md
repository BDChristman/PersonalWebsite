I am a Biostatistics and Data Science doctoral student in the School of Population Health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Broadly, I am interested in developing statistical methodologies for medical applications and identifying/assessing health problems in the Southeastern United States.  

My current research is focused on two different topics, indirect treatment comparison methodology and non-fatal suicidal behaviors among Mississippi adolescents. My goal is to produce research that informs pharmaceutical practices and aids in reducing the occurrence of adolescent suicide.
