I am a Biostatistics and Data Science PhD student in the School of Population Health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Broadly, I am interested in developing statistical methodologies and assessing health disparities in the southeastern United States.

My current research focuses on two different topics: youth suicide in Mississippi and indirect treatment comparison. Through the youth suicide research, I hope to provide population specific insights on youth suicide and contribute to the implementation of intervention methods to decrease suicide rates in Mississippi. Through the indirect treatment comparison research, I hope to further develop the methodological framework for indirectly comparing medications and ultimately help to inform medication prescription decisions.
