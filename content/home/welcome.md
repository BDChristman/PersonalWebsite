I was born and raised in Schwenksville, PA. Most of my childhood was spent playing baseball, practicing guitar and saxophone, or roaming through the woods.

I moved from Schwenksville to Memphis, TN to attend Rhodes College. While there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of research projects. The most impactful of which came through an off-campus internship at the University of Tennessee Health Science Centerâ€™s Department of Preventive Medicine. Through this internship, I worked to identify the factors that contribute to the disparate development and outcomes of prostate cancer in African-Americans in the American Mid-South. This opportunity largely shaped my career interests by introducing me to the fields of biostatistics, epidemiology, and data science while building on my medical and social interests.

In my free time, I like to practice and perform on the saxophone. I have been fortunate enough to play with artists such as Bobby Rush and Spaceface. I also like to play chess, birdwatch, and run.
