Most of my childhood was spent at gymnastics and diving practice, collecting grasshoppers and butterflies, and playing in the woods in Schwenksville, PA. For my undergraduate, I attended Denison University - the college on the hill, where I worked as a greenhouse assistant and animal caretaker for the Biology Department. During this time, I expanded my love of nature by participating in research projects on the "Comparative study of insect diversity at three successional landscapes" in Ohio and the "Influence of ecotourism on Allenâ€™s Cay rock iguanas" in the Bahamas. Currently I am living in Logan, Utah while attending Utah State University. In my free time, I like traveling to national parks as well as hiking and going to the dog park with my mischevious pitbull, Carlton. I also spend a great deal of time at the boxing gym training and coaching.
