I was raised in Schwenksville, Pennsylvania. Most of childhood was spent at gymnastics and diving practice, collecting grasshoppers and butterflies, and playing in the woods. For college, I moved to the adorable town on the hill in Granville, Ohio where I worked as a greenhouse assistant and animal caretaker for the Biology Department. While at Denison, I expanded my love of nature by participating in research projects on the "Comparative study of insect diversity at three successional landscapes" and the "Influence of ecotourism on Allenâ€™s Cay rock iguanas".
